# Build With React ⚛️  
_A modern React + Next.js project collection showcasing clean architecture and real-world builds._

> _Resource Reference:_ [Course Material](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

A collection of high-quality, production-ready React projects built while deep-diving into the latest React ecosystem — including **Next.js 14+, Redux, Hooks, and React Router**.  
These applications demonstrate a strong understanding of front-end architecture, state management, routing, authentication, and best practices for building scalable React applications.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository showcases a series of React and Next.js applications developed as part of a comprehensive, full-stack React development program.  
Each project focuses on modern React patterns and practical, real-world implementations, from dynamic UI components to full-stack React + Next.js integrations.

## 🧩 Key Highlights

- ⚛️ **Modern React Development** — Built with React 18+ using functional components and Hooks for clean, maintainable code.  
- 🔄 **State Management Mastery** — Implemented global state using **Context API** and **Redux Toolkit** for complex, data-driven applications.  
- 🧭 **Routing & Navigation** — Set up dynamic and nested routes with **React Router**, including route-based data fetching.  
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Applications** — Integrated front-end React apps with real or mock backends via RESTful HTTP requests.  
- 🔐 **Authentication Systems** — Implemented user login, registration, and protected routes to demonstrate secure app design.  
- ⚙️ **Next.js 14+** — Leveraged the latest Next.js features for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.  
- 🧪 **Testing Foundations** — Introduced **unit testing** practices for React components to ensure reliability and maintainability.  
- 🎨 **Best Practices** — Followed modern React coding standards, performance optimization, and reusable component architecture.
